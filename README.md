Why?
====
Because I was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes two weeks ago, so I have lots of juicy data from the [OnTrack Diabetes app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gexperts.ontrack&hl=en) to play with.

What?
=====

Right now it just consumes the CSV file exported by the app and turns it into some nicely structured objects. MongoDB may join the game soon. There's also some Postfix voodoo, which I will document here later.
