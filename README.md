Why?
====
Because I was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes two weeks ago, so I have lots of juicy data from the [OnTrack Diabetes app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gexperts.ontrack&hl=en) to play with.

What?
=====

(Optionally) consumes the export CSV from the app, turns it into some nice Ruby objects, and stuffs it into MongoDB. Simple querying works right now.

There's also some Postfix voodoo which I'll document here later.
