Add flags to do things like
* Crash analysis (you crashed n hours after taking this much insulin or so)
* Show just today's, this week's data
* Show just a particular type or tag
* Export to CSV for spreadsheet

Highlight good/bad BG values? With colours?

Also modify the Postfix trick to call the script, feeding in the latest CSV file. So the script should actually take the path to the CSV as a parameter.
